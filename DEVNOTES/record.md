# Project record

**Reader:** anyone tracing how Polaris reached its current shape; a
maintainer checking whether a piece of scope was shipped, retired or
reopened. **Job:** the historical record that used to live at the end of
[MISSION.md](../MISSION.md): the v1 and v2 done-lists, the retired
cognitive-apparatus arcs, and the production-deployment phase log. It was
moved here on 2026-09-02 (v9.195) so the constitution carries only the
constitution. The text is the record as written at the time, kept
verbatim apart from two citations of files that no longer exist; ticket
labels such as M2-1 or R11-3 are the labels the CHANGELOG and the
per-ship notes in [ships/](ships/) still use. Where this record and the
running code disagree, the code and [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) are
authoritative.

## What "done" looks like for Polaris

The done-list has two epochs. The v1 done-list (the SCS-230 deliverable
arc) closed on 2026-05-09 with 12 of 15 items shipped and 3 retired
(items 13–15, v8.27). The v2 done-list extended Polaris from "the
schema implements the design" to "the system stands behind the
design's claims" — the combination of substrate-level demonstrations
(PDF Appendices E and F as code) and the open problems the report
itself names as deferred (PDF §9). **v2 closed 2026-05-12 at 12/12 ✅
with the v8.28 UI graduation phase** (Option 3 close-out: dashboard
substrate tiles, `/anchors` / `/epochs` / `/federation` viewers, token
detail v2 state section). Both epochs are listed below: v1 as the
historical record, v2 as the closed mission.
### v1 done-list (closed 2026-05-09)

1. ✅ Schema models the full lifecycle of an identity token (achieved v1)
2. ✅ Stored procedures cover UC-1 through UC-7 (achieved v1)
3. ✅ Application layer enforces context-scoped verification (achieved v3)
4. ✅ Cybersecurity controls: CSP, CSRF, rate-limit, role-based auth (achieved v4)
5. ✅ Concurrency hazards identified and sealed with tests (achieved v6)
6. ✅ Scales to 2M+ events with bounded API responses (achieved v6)
7. ✅ Test coverage: 1077 Python (12 test classes incl. property + redaction-property) + 171 SQL self-tests (achieved v6/v7; growing each release)
8. ✅ Threat model: STRIDE-categorized, every threat mapped to a control (DEVNOTES/threat-model.md)
9. ✅ Antimeridian-spanning bbox queries (wrap-aware predicate; 11_atlas.sql)
10. ✅ Cursor pagination on list pages (achieved v7.4 — keyset cursors on /tokens and /verifications)
11. ✅ Property-based tests for invariants (19 Hypothesis tests on C1, C2, C3 in test_invariants_property.py)
12. ✅ Multi-process rate limiter (Redis-backed) (achieved v7.5 — `InMemoryRateLimiter` + `RedisRateLimiter` with auto-selection)
13. ✗ External IdP integration (OIDC) — RETIRED 2026-05-09 (out of v1 scope; not on v2; do not auto-propose)
14. ✗ Banking-on-Polaris reference architecture (separate repo) — RETIRED 2026-05-09 (correct answer is a separate repo consuming Polaris over HTTP; not on v2)
15. ✗ Linux + Windows variant of the launcher — RETIRED 2026-05-09 (macOS launcher is the SCS-230 deliverable surface; cross-platform is an operational concern, not a mission item)

**Note on retirement.** Items 13–15 were marked `⏸ DEFERRED` from
2026-05-09 to v8.26, then re-classified as `✗ RETIRED` once it
became clear (after the v2 close-out) that they were not paused
pending a future epoch — they were outside the mission scope.
They stay
skipped. Audit-of-record: the `DEFERRED 2026-05-09` history is
preserved in this annotation; nothing was deleted.

### v2 done-list (closed 2026-05-12 at 12/12 ✅, opened 2026-05-09)

The v2 arc is **D + A** (substrate-level demonstrations + the report's
open problems).

**Substrate-level demonstrations (D — make Appendices E and F concrete):**

M2-1. ✅ **Real ZK-SNARK for ZERO_KNOWLEDGE verifications** (achieved
       v8.23 / R10-1 — `TokenStateEpoch` table is the 7th audit-of-record;
       Plonky2 SNARK (FRI-based, post-quantum-comfortable) proves Merkle
       inclusion bound to `(epoch_id, context_id, nonce)` public inputs;
       Rust crate `polaris_zk/` provides the prover/verifier CLI;
       `polaris_web/zk.py` is the subprocess wrapper; `uc11_close_epoch`
       procedure with per-procedure advisory lock (6th catalog entry);
       three `/api/zk/*` routes (epoch close, get, verify); 5 SQL self-
       tests in section P, 15+ Python `ZKSnarkTests`, 3 Rust unit tests
       (honest prover, replay, cross-epoch), 2 concurrency tests. C3+A4+B3
       picked by VANTA at the M2-1 exploration Sanctum: transparent setup,
       Plonky2, hybrid-Merkle reusing R10-2. **Substrate-D arc closed
       5/5** — every primitive named in PDF Appendices E and F is now
       in-tree or scaffolded.).

M2-2. ✅ **Functional DID anchoring** (achieved v8.21 / R10-2 —
       `AnchorBatch` table is the off-chain audit-of-record;
       `close_anchor_batch(algorithm_id, root, proofs)` procedure
       groups pending `BlockchainAnchor` rows by signature algorithm
       under a per-algorithm advisory-lock (4th entry in the catalog);
       `polaris_web/anchoring.py` Merkle helper (SHA3-256 default, sort
       by anchor_id for publish-then-fork resistance); three Flask
       routes (`/api/anchor/batch`, `/api/anchor/<token_id>`,
       `/api/anchor/verify/<token_id>`) — the last one server-side
       reconstructs the Merkle root from leaf + proof and rejects
       tampered logs; 5 SQL self-tests in section O, 15 Python tests in
       `AnchorBatchTests`, 2 concurrency tests for the lock contract.
       Substrate-D arc closed 5/5 — M2-1 ZK-SNARK delivered v8.23).

M2-3. ✅ **Substrate-dependency manifest** (achieved v8 —
       `DEVNOTES/substrate.md` is the prose form; `SystemDependency` view
       in `polaris_sql/13_substrate.sql` is the queryable mirror; 27 rows
       across 7 layers (crypto, network, storage, runtime, standards,
       hardware, human); `SubstrateManifestTests` confirms the prose and
       SQL forms agree).

M2-4. ✅ **GenomicAnchor schema (Appendix F.1)** (achieved v8 — table with
       three CHECK constraints: hex-only, algorithm-specific length, and
       genomic-alphabet refusal; 11 tests in `GenomicAnchorTests`).

M2-5. ✅ **QuantumObserverBinding scaffold (Appendix F.2).** Schema
       scaffold with explicit DEFERRED markers on functional fields, and
       a rationale doc explaining what the binding becomes when
       quantum-observer hardware is real. Acceptance: table exists,
       comments explain the deferred state, schema does not block the
       eventual functional implementation.

**The PDF's open problems (A — close the loops §9 explicitly opens):**

M2-6. ✅ **Multi-signature transitional state** (achieved v8.18 /
       R11-1 — `TokenSignature` M:N table with UNIQUE composite key
       and deprecation_after_signed CHECK; partial index on active
       set; two triggers — `enforce_token_has_active_signature`
       (≥ 1 active per token) and `enforce_token_signature_immutability`
       (write-once except for one-way deprecation_date);
       `uc6_migrate_algorithm` procedure with `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
       on token_id for C9 correctness; UC-1 and UC-9 extended to
       insert TokenSignature alongside the new IdentityToken; backfill
       block for v1 sample tokens; verification path + dashboard
       Post-Quantum panel read from TokenSignature; 16 tests in
       `MultiSignatureTests` + 3 in `ConcurrencyTests` (per-token race,
       verify+migrate snapshot consistency, cross-token parallelism)
       + 5 SQL self-tests in section N; `DEVNOTES/ships/multi-sig-migration.md`
       documents the adversary walk, the verification consistency
       model, the no-auto-derivation argument, and the
       issuer-trust-concentration triad positioning. Closes the
       cryptographic-diversity leg of PDF §9 alongside R11-6 ✅;
       M2-8 federation remains the unbuilt third leg.)

M2-7. ✅ **Catastrophic-loss recovery — UC-9** (achieved v8.17 /
       R11-2 — `RecoveryRequest` table with four CHECK constraints
       encoding the mechanism: 48h cool-down minimum, three-channel
       OOB verification required for APPROVED, decided_at after
       cool-down, approver ≠ requester; partial unique index
       `uq_one_pending_recovery_per_individual` for one PENDING per
       individual; two-phase procedures `uc9_initiate_recovery`
       (operator) + `uc9_complete_recovery` (admin only, RAISE
       EXCEPTION enforced); `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on
       claimed_individual_id for C9 correctness; APPROVED branch
       transitions non-terminal tokens to LOST + publishes each to
       RevocationList + issues new ACTIVE token with
       predecessor_token_id=NULL + tags all lifecycle rows with
       `[RECOVERY:<id>]`; three Flask routes + templates;
       15 CatastrophicLossRecoveryTests + 2 ConcurrencyTests; 5 SQL
       self-tests in section M; `DEVNOTES/ships/recovery-ceremony.md`
       documents the adversary walk, mechanism design, and the
       administrative-vs-operational grace-period framing. The third
       leg of the "schema doesn't weaponize itself against the
       holder" triad (entry R11-4, exit R11-6, recovery this).)

M2-8. ✅ **Issuer federation model** (achieved v8.22 / R11-3 —
       `AgencyTrustAttestation` table is the 6th audit-of-record;
       `enforce_attestation_immutability` trigger enforces one-way
       revocation; `uc10_attest_trust` + `uc10_revoke_attestation`
       procedures with per-attesting-agency advisory lock (5th catalog
       entry); explicit-only federation (NO transitive trust);
       verification flow gates SUCCESS outcomes by `_federation_trust_holds`
       check; `/api/federation/attest` + `/api/federation/revoke`
       routes (admin); 6-row seed graph explains existing demo
       verifications; 15 `IssuerFederationTests` + 2 concurrency tests
       + 5 SQL self-tests in section P. Closes the issuer-trust-
       concentration triad to 3/3 (after R11-1 cryptographic diversity
       and R11-6 constitutional limits).

M2-9. ✅ **Tiered enrollment / population coverage** (achieved v8.16 /
       R11-4 — `EnrollmentStatusEvent` table with 5-status CHECK enum;
       `IndividualCurrentEnrollment` view returns latest event per
       individual with COALESCE fallback to `NOT_ENROLLED`;
       `seed_default_enrollment_status` trigger materializes the
       default state on every new Individual; append-only invariant
       extended to the new table; `civic_enrollment_summary` function
       returns per-jurisdiction × status counts only — per-individual
       NOT_ENROLLED enumeration deliberately not first-class;
       10 tests in `TieredEnrollmentTests` + 5 SQL self-tests in
       section L; `DEVNOTES/ships/tiered-enrollment.md` documents the
       asymmetric design (EXEMPT frictionless, mass-NOT_ENROLLED
       enumeration deliberate) and the PDF §9 anchoring.)

M2-10. ✅ **Compulsion resistance — duress codes (§9.5)** (achieved
       v8.24 / R11-5 — `IdentityToken.duress_code_hash` Werkzeug scrypt
       commitment; `DuressEvent` table is the 8th audit-of-record
       (append-only via `reject_audit_modification`);
       `uc12_record_duress` procedure with no advisory lock (pure
       append, no contention); `_check_and_record_duress` helper uses
       `werkzeug.security.check_password_hash` for constant-time
       comparison; the verification flow proceeds identically to the
       coercer (R2 audit refinement) while silently writing the
       DuressEvent; `/api/duress/events` (admin/auditor) is the OOB
       dashboard; `/verifications` operator list does NOT join to
       DuressEvent (R6 anti-revealing posture); 5 SQL self-tests in
       section R + 13 `DuressCodeTests`. **The v2 mission-closer —
       v2 done-list = 12/12 ✅.**).

M2-11. ✅ **Issuer-discretion bounds** (achieved v8.15 / R11-6 —
       `IssuerDiscretionPolicy` table for per-agency overrides;
       `uc8_revoke_token` stored procedure enforces a rolling N%/W-day
       cap with optional higher-authority co-signer; system defaults
       N=5.00% / W=30 days set via `ALTER DATABASE` GUCs;
       `enforce_revocation_velocity_bound` belt-and-suspenders trigger
       rejects raw UPDATEs; `pg_advisory_xact_lock` per agency_id
       serializes concurrent boundary races for C9 correctness;
       11 tests in `IssuerDiscretionBoundsTests` + 2 in
       `ConcurrencyTests` + 7 SQL self-tests in section K;
       `DEVNOTES/ships/issuer-discretion.md` documents the policy choices,
       adversary walk, and PDF §9 anchoring).

M2-12. ✅ **Verification-graph redaction proof** (achieved v8 —
       `meta/redaction-proof.md` documents the adversary model and the
       five enumerated side-channels; `test_redaction_property.py`
       instantiates a `UniformGuessAdversary` against ZK-only sequences
       and confirms the privacy bound, plus a `TemporalCorrelationAdversary`
       and `SpatialUniquenessAdversary` that prove CE-1 and CE-2 succeed
       — the documented operational limitations the schema cannot
       mitigate; 6 tests in `RedactionPropertyTests`).

Items M2-1..M2-5 are the substrate arc (D); M2-6..M2-12 are the open-
problems arc (A). Roadmap sequencing in `ROADMAP.md` (R10-* for D items,
R11-* for A items). Risk classes range from LOW (M2-3, M2-5, M2-12) to
HIGH (M2-1: cryptographic rabbit hole; M2-8: cross-jurisdiction trust
model). The agent should treat MEDIUM/HIGH items as propose-and-wait
unless the user has explicitly authorized autonomous execution for the
specific item.

### Arcs D / E / F / G — the cognitive apparatus (RETIRED v9.55)

Between 2026-05-12 and 2026-05-14, Polaris grew a large self-monitoring
apparatus: **Arc D** (the "HYDRA" host + a cohort of read-only
watchers), **Arc E** (the "Mycelium" pheromone swarm plus a Roman
"legion" / "Civitas" organizational metaphor), **Arc F** (the
"Denarius" swarm-internal economy), and **Arc G** (a "Roman Empire"
expansion). It was roughly 18k lines of code plus a comparable mass of
narrative, and it observed C1-C10 without ever being imported by the
product.

**v9.55 cut all four arcs wholesale** (CHANGELOG v9.50–v9.55). The job
they nominally did — confirming the constitutional invariants hold — is
now done by the flat, tested `polaris_checks/` layer in ~350 legible
lines. The apparatus packages (`polaris_swarm/`, `polaris_hydra/`,
`polaris_foresight/`), their scripts, their mythology docs, and the
`Pheromone` schema were all deleted. This was authorized as a
de-larping pass: the apparatus had become a self-referential web that
made Polaris read as theater rather than as the serious reference
implementation it is. Legibility is itself an anti-coercion property —
a system whose guarantees you can read in an afternoon is one you can
trust without taking it on faith — so the cut strengthens the Vocation
rather than weakening it.

### Arc B — Production deployment (active multi-phase, opened 2026-05-14)

Production-readiness arc. Polaris was, before v8.77,
**architecturally rich but productionally thin**: cryptography,
schema, and audit-of-record were production-grade, but the
deployment story was the dev launcher.
A reference implementation that no operator can deploy is not
actually a reference. Arc B closes that gap.

**Phase 1 (✅ shipped 2026-05-14 as v8.77):** TLS via Caddy
(Let's Encrypt auto), file-mounted secrets (Docker secrets at
`/run/secrets/`), structured `/api/health` JSON with per-component
checks, multi-stage non-root Dockerfile.prod, idempotent
`polaris-deploy.sh` with rollback-on-fail, manifest-verified
`polaris-backup.sh`, secret-rotation tooling, and the operator
runbook + secrets primer. **G27** (TLS required), **G28** (no
sensitive env-var literals in prod compose), **G29** (structured
health JSON) added.

**Phase 2 (⬜ deferred):** WebAuthn + hardware-token operator auth;
audit-log archive policy (S3 / Glacier rotation); multi-instance
scaling (pgbouncer + gunicorn tuning + Redis cluster);
`polaris-restore.sh` recovery-from-backup with validation.

**Phase 3 (⬜ deferred):** Multi-region deployment patterns;
disaster-recovery runbook (RPO/RTO targets); SOC 2 readiness
checklist.

**Done-list:** R16-1..R16-10 (Phase 1) all ✅. R16-* sequence in
`ROADMAP.md`.

Phases 2 and 3 above were written as deferred; every item in them has
since shipped (WebAuthn at v8.97, restore and DR runbooks, PgBouncer and
Redis scaling, the monthly DR drill at v9.192). The current plan is
[ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md); the operator runbooks are under
[docs/operator/](../docs/operator/README.md).
