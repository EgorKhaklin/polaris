# SLOS.md: Polaris service-level objectives (reference targets)

This document states the service-level objectives (SLOs) Polaris is designed
to meet, the service-level indicators (SLIs) that measure them, and the error
budget each implies.

> **Honest status (v9.123).** These are **reference targets for a notional
> deployment**, not a measured guarantee. Polaris ships the metrics and the
> alerting rules that make these objectives observable, but it does not ship
> the measurement backend: the Prometheus + Alertmanager stack is
> **operator-gated** (see [`../../deploy/observability/README.md`](../../deploy/observability/README.md)).
> No SLO here is enforced by Polaris at runtime. An operator who wires the
> stack and runs at scale will measure their own numbers; the targets below
> are the design intent and a starting point for a real error-budget policy,
> not a claim about an SLO Polaris itself meets.

Every SLI below is grounded in a metric Polaris **actually exposes** on
`/metrics` (Prometheus text exposition) or `/api/metrics` (JSON). Nothing here
references a metric the app does not emit.

## 1. The exposed metrics these SLOs are built on

| Metric | Type | Labels | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `polaris_requests_total` | counter | `route`, `method`, `status` | `polaris_web/app.py` (`_metrics_after_request`) |
| `polaris_request_latency_seconds` | histogram | `route` | `polaris_web/app.py` (`_metrics_after_request`) |
| `polaris_db_query_latency_seconds` | histogram | (none) | `polaris_web/app.py` (`/api/health` DB probe) |
| `polaris_app_info` | gauge (always 1) | `version` | `polaris_web/app.py` (refreshed at scrape) |
| `polaris_agency_events_total` | counter | `kind`, `agency_id` | `polaris_web/app.py` (the issue, revoke, and verify routes; v9.190). Not an SLI: the velocity alerts compare each agency against its own baseline |
| `polaris_quota_refusals_total` | counter | `kind`, `agency_id` | `polaris_web/app.py` (a quota refusal answered as 429; v9.190). Not an SLI: a refusal is the control working |
| `up{job="polaris"}` | gauge | Prometheus built-in | the scrape itself |

The JSON `/api/metrics` snapshot (`request_rate_per_minute`,
`error_rate_per_minute`, `auth_failures_per_minute`, `duress_events_total`,
`uptime_seconds`) is a human-readable rolling-window view from
`polaris_web/observability.py`. It is **not** the SLI source: it exposes rates,
not percentiles, and its windows reset on process restart. The SLOs below are
computed from the Prometheus metrics, which are the durable, aggregatable
series.

As of v9.120, `/metrics` aggregates across all gunicorn workers (Prometheus
multiprocess mode), so a ratio or quantile taken over `polaris_requests_total`
or the latency histograms reflects the whole app, not one worker.

## 2. Availability SLO

**Objective:** 99.9% of HTTP requests succeed (non-5xx) over a rolling 30-day
window.

**SLI (the success ratio):**

```promql
1 - (
  sum(rate(polaris_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[30d]))
  / sum(rate(polaris_requests_total[30d]))
)
```

This is the exact complement of the `PolarisHigh5xx` alert ratio
(`deploy/observability/polaris-alerts.yml`), evaluated over the SLO window
rather than the alert's 5-minute window. A request that returns 5xx (a server
error or an uncaught exception, which the after-request hook records as a 5xx)
is a failed request; everything else (including a 4xx, which is a caller error,
not a service failure) is a success.

**Target:** ≥ 99.9% success → an error budget of **0.1% of requests** per 30
days.

`PolarisHigh5xx` fires at a **1% sustained 5xx share over 10 minutes**. That is
intentionally an order of magnitude above the 0.1% SLO budget: the alert is a
"you are burning budget fast right now" page, not the SLO boundary itself. A
brief spike that clears inside 10 minutes does not page but still spends
budget, which is the point of tracking the budget separately from the alert.

---

## 3. Latency SLO

**Objective:** the p99 of per-route request latency stays under **2 seconds**
over a rolling 30-day window.

**SLI:**

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum(rate(polaris_request_latency_seconds_bucket[30d])) by (le))
```

`polaris_request_latency_seconds` is a real histogram with `_bucket` series, so
`histogram_quantile` is valid (this is not a synthetic percentile). The 2s
threshold is the same boundary `PolarisHighRequestLatency` alerts on
(SEV-3, `for: 10m`); the SLO is the long-window version of that alert.

**Target:** p99 < 2s. This is a degraded-experience boundary, not an outage
boundary, which is why the matching alert is SEV-3 (degraded, not down).

A secondary, gentler objective an operator may adopt: **p50 < 200ms**, computed
by substituting `0.50` for `0.99` above. Polaris does not ship an alert at p50;
it is offered here as a latency-budget reference, not a paging condition.

---

## 4. Database-latency SLO

**Objective:** the p99 of the `/api/health` database round-trip stays under
**5 seconds**.

**SLI:**

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum(rate(polaris_db_query_latency_seconds_bucket[30d])) by (le))
```

`polaris_db_query_latency_seconds` is recorded only from the `/api/health` DB
probe, so this SLO measures **database reachability and responsiveness as the
health check sees it**, not the latency of every application query. It is a
saturation signal: a p99 climbing toward 5s means the database is slow or
saturated before most user-facing flows have failed outright.

**Target:** p99 < 5s. This is the same boundary `PolarisHighDBLatency` alerts
on (SEV-2, `for: 5m`) and the same threshold `docs/operator/DR.md` maps to
SEV-2.

---

## 5. Error budget

For a 99.9% availability SLO over 30 days, the error budget is **0.1% of
requests**. Expressed as time-equivalent downtime (the familiar "three nines"
figure), 99.9% over 30 days allows roughly **43 minutes** of full outage per
month before the budget is exhausted.

A simple budget-tracking expression (fraction of the 30-day budget already
spent):

```promql
(
  sum(increase(polaris_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[30d]))
  / sum(increase(polaris_requests_total[30d]))
) / 0.001
```

A value ≥ 1 means the month's budget is spent. Polaris does **not** ship a
burn-rate alert (multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerting is an operator policy
decision, and the alert set is deliberately small). The expression above is a
dashboard query, not a shipped rule.

The availability and DB-latency alerts route to a pager only once the operator
wires Alertmanager. Until then, the budget is observable on a dashboard but not
actioned automatically. Stating otherwise would overclaim what ships.

## 6. What is deliberately NOT an SLO

- **`duress_events_total`** is not an availability or latency signal. A duress
  event is a person signalling coercion, not a service failure; aggregating it
  into a reliability budget would be a category error (and a surveillance
  hazard). Treat any non-zero value as an incident to investigate per
  `docs/operator/OPERATIONS.md`, not as budget spend.
- **`auth_failures_per_minute`** is a security signal, not a reliability SLI.
  Failed logins are an expected, adversary-driven quantity; folding them into
  an availability number would let an attacker move the SLO by guessing
  passwords.
- **Per-person or per-agency availability.** Polaris does not slice these SLIs
  by identity, and it must not: an SLO computed per individual would be a
  reconstructable activity record. The SLIs above aggregate over all requests
  by design (vocation: no aggregation vector).
